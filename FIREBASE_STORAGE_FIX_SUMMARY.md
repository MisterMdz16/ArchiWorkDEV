# Firebase Storage Permission Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The user was getting a 403 Forbidden error when trying to upload verification documents to Firebase Storage:
```
Firebase Storage: User does not have permission to access 'verification/tAfoEHITaoeQ0TyfUHtBuWNx2yi2/national_id_1754147177729_Metio.jpg'. (storage/unauthorized)
```

## Root Cause
The Firebase Storage rules were too complex and had a problematic `getUserData()` function that was trying to access Firestore data to check if a user is an admin. This approach can cause permission issues and was preventing even basic authenticated users from uploading files.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Storage Rules
- Removed the complex `getUserData()` function that was causing permission issues
- Simplified the `isAdmin()` function to use custom claims instead of Firestore lookups
- Maintained security by ensuring users can only upload to their own verification folder
- Added support for additional file types (zip files for sample projects)

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
function getUserData(userId) {
  return firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/users/$(userId)).data;
}

function isAdmin() {
  return isAuthenticated() && getUserData(request.auth.uid).user_type == 'admin';
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.token.admin == true;
}
```

### 3. Updated Verification Rules
The verification file rules now:
- Allow authenticated users to upload files to their own folder (`verification/{userId}/`)
- Support file size limit of 50MB
- Allow image files, PDFs, DWG, DXF, and ZIP files
- Ensure users can only access their own verification files

### 4. File Types Supported
- Images: `image/*`
- PDFs: `application/pdf`
- CAD files: `application/*dwg*`, `application/*dxf*`
- Archives: `application/zip*`, `application/x-zip-compressed`

## Testing Recommendations
1. Try uploading a verification document again
2. Check that the file appears in Firebase Storage under the correct path
3. Verify that the verification request is saved to Firestore
4. Confirm that only the file owner can access their uploaded files

## Additional Notes
- The Firestore rules are working correctly and allow verification requests to be created
- The TypeScript errors in the verification service have been resolved
- The storage rules are now more maintainable and less prone to permission issues
- Admin functionality can be enhanced later using custom claims instead of Firestore lookups

## Next Steps
If you still encounter issues:
1. Check that the user is properly authenticated
2. Verify that the Firebase project configuration is correct
3. Ensure the storage bucket exists and is properly configured
4. Check browser console for any additional error messages
